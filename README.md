## Description
    For this project I needed to create a timed multiple choice quiz with a scoreboard. This was a challenge in a lot of ways. I started by creating the html and css elements and design. Once that was finished the real challenge began as I began to code the JavaScript. I created a 'hide' element that allows me to hide or display the questions, start button, and end screen with java viaa seri es of .add() and .remove(). I tied event listeners to multiple functions allowing new questions to pop up at random as well as submit scores to a local storage. This project taught me a lot with over 300 lines of code. It got me to understand more of the js logic I will need to create even more complex programs.
